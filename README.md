# ProjetMobileNewsApp

This is a mobile application programmed in Java using Android Studio.

The main objective was to create an application using an API, so I chose a news related API: https://newsapi.org/

Here is how it should look like from the get go:

<a href = "img/main_activityy.png"> <img src = "img/main_activityy.png" /> <a>
